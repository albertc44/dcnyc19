# Machine Learning Workflows and Platforms

This track will talk about the practice of moving machine learning
systems from development to deployment, and the next generation
tooling that makes this an organic process. Removing barriers to
deployment allow data scientists to gain quicker feedback and deeper
insights into how models are performing in the wild, and enable
nimbler experimentation at the product level.

To do this, new machine learning workflows are taking advantage of
serverless and container orchestration technologies, and also
specializing frameworks towards certain classes of data science
problems.

This track is for the hands on practitioners who fluidly cross the
boundary between research and deployment.

- Kubeflow seems like a significant development, and it would be great
  to see a preview of how it approaches managing workflows (@wesc)
