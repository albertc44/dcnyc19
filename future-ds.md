# Future of Data Science

This track is focused on the cutting edge of data science. Talks will
be slightly more speculative, and represent the state of the art of
data science and machine learning. Good examples include academic
talks aimed at solving hard problems in data science,
technology-focused talks from startups aiming to commercialize new
technologies, and product talks (possibly post-mortem!) about attempts
to use new technologies to deliver business value.

The goal of this track is to share lessons from past attempts to use
new technologies, to encourage the diffusion of technology from
academic research into industry, and to provide inspirational examples
of the creative application of research toward creating the
technologies of our future.

This track is for anyone looking for inspiration to innovate in
product development by applying new research, and who in interested in
listening to an occasional academic-level research talk.
