# Core Data Science

This track focuses on applications of ML and analytics methods in a
product context. It can include new approaches to ML, as long as
projects show solid proofs of value. Examples include AB testing
analysis methods, interesting product case studies, applications of ML
algorithms to generate business value, reviews of the state of the art
(e.g. best practices talks for production model validation), and
similar context-focused technical talks.

The goal of this track is to share best practices about everyday data
science practice, to learn from each other's hard lessons, and to keep
everyone up to date with technologies that have proven their value.

This track is for the everyday data scientist, or engineers wanting to
learn more about what data science is all about. Talks will often get
into some technical detail, but should also be of interest to product
managers wanting to understand how to do more to integrate data
science into their product development process.
