# Streaming Systems

This track looks at infrastructure used to build realtime applications
and the underlying data infrastructure that supports the movement of
data to computation. Examples of talks include case studies on how
applications use messaging systems, how applications maintain
consistency and correctness while ingesting large amounts of data, and
computational frameworks for processing data with low latency.

This is a practical track for anybody looking to design the backbone
of a data intensive application architecture.
