# Data Organizations & Ethics

This track will cover various topics related to building data
organizations as well as the ethical implications of the work we do as
data professionals. Some companies are just getting started with data,
some have a more mature data team and process, and some simply have
too much data and too small of a team to manage it! On top of it all,
many are unaware, or perhaps unconcerned about the ethical
implications of their work.

Throughout our conference series, we've found that bringing together
an assortment of different types and sizes of companies, as well as a
mix of professional roles, who openly discuss organizational and
cultural challenges is the best way to further the development of
mature data organizations across industries. This track aims to share
and spread that knowledge.

Furthermore, as our data teams continue to push the technical
boundaries of what is possible, the ethical implications of massive
data repositories combined with advanced data mining techniques,
machine learning algos, and deep learning in general are raising
important considerations in the area of data ethics.

This track will be applicable to you if you are an engineering or data
manager, if you are interested in building a stronger organizational
culture around data teams, or if you are concerned about policy and
ethical considerations surrounding the use of data in your
organization.
